        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
        "   - Python is an open-source, object-oriented, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is easy to learn/understand. Python runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, so we can use it anywhere. we can use Python for almost anything websites, data analysis, AI, automation, and more.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
        "   - An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code line by line. It reads the code, converts it into machine-readable instructions, and runs it immediately, without needing to compile the entire program beforehand.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "  - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words with special meanings that define the structure and functionality of a program. They cannot be used as variable names and are case-sensitive. Examples: if, else, for, while, def, class, and import. we can view them using help(\"keywords\").\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
        "  - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Keywords are reserved words with special meanings in the language, and using them as variable names will result in a SyntaxError\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python ?\n",
        "  -Mutable is when something is changeable or has the ability to change. In Python, mutable is the ability of objects to change their values. These are often the objects that store a collection of data. Examples: Lists ,Sets, Dictionaries, etc.\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "  -Lists are mutable because they are meant for dynamic data manipulation, allowing modifications like adding, removing, or changing elements. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable to ensure data consistency, enable hashability, and provide better performance for fixed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n",
        "  - The == operator checks if the values of two objects are equal, while the `is operator checks if they refer to the same memory location. Use == for value comparison and is for identity comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
        "  - Logical operators in Python are used to combine or modify conditional statements like AND, OR, NOT.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python ?\n",
        "  - Type casting in Python is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. It allows you to explicitly change the type of a value, like converting a string to an integer or a float to a string. Python provides built-in functions for type casting, such as int(), float(), str(), and list().\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n",
        "  - Implicit type casting is automatically done by Python when converting smaller data types to larger ones (e.g., int to float) without data loss. Explicit type casting is manually performed by the programmer using functions like int(), float(), or str() and may result in data loss or errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
        "  - The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to execute specific blocks of code based on whether a given condition is True or False. Example: if, else, elif\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work ?\n",
        "  - The elif statement in Python stands for \"else if\" and is used to check multiple conditions after an initial if statement. If the if condition is False, Python evaluates the elif conditions in order. The first elif condition that evaluates to True executes its block of code, and the rest are skipped. If no conditions are True, the optional else block runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  - for loop used to iterate over a sequence. It repeats a block of code for each item in the sequence, typically when the number of iterations is already known. Where as while loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains True. It is typically used when the number of iterations is not known and depends on runtime conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop ?\n",
        "  - If you are writing a program that repeatedly asks a user for input until they enter a valid response, a while loop would be ideal. You don't know how many attempts the user will need, but you want the loop to continue until the input is correct."
